% different fruit name, and each element in the second column is a diferent
% numeric value (double)



% 2. Load data in lecture5_grpEx2_concussion_subset.mat and do the following:
% load data

% Find logical indices of type corresponding to Pro with strcmp

% Find numerical indices of type corresponding to Am with strcmp

% Find logical indices of type corresponding to Am with the logical
% operator for NOT

% Calculate total # concussions for all Pro types using any method




% 3. Define a cell array that is the same # rows as concuss_num, and 1

    7 8 9];
% First element

% 4th element

% Element in the first row and third column

% All elements in the second column 


% 2. Indexing multiple rows and columns simultaneously
% Write the correct notation to extract the following elements from the
% matrix below:
A = [1 1 1 4 4
    6 6 6 3 3
    5 5 5 2 2
    10 -2 -2 -2 10];
% first row, columns 1 to 3

% last row, columns 2 to 4

% rows 1 and 3, columns 3 and 5


% 3. Adding elements to a matrix
% Write the correct notation to do the following to A:
A = [ 1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9];
% Add the number 10 to the position in the 4th row and 3rd column

% Change the value at row 2 column 3 to 10

% Add a 5th row of all ones



% 4. Removing elements from a matrix
% Write the correct notation to do the following to A:
A = [1 3 5 7];

% Remove the element with value 5
A(3) = []



% 5. Changing specific elements of a matrix
% Write the correct notation to do the following to A:
A = [1 1 1; 2 2 2];

% Change the element in the second row and first column to 10

% Change the first row to all 3's

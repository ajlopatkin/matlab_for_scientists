% Details:
% lecture3_grpEx1_HRData.mat contains three column vectors of data taken
% from the same 11 patients (see screenshot on slide 32). 
% You can assume the order of the patients is
% the same for each vector. One vector consists of systolic blood pressure, 
% the second  contains the patients age, and the third
% column contains the patient weight in pounds.



% 1. Load in the data. Create a single matrix called Mat where every row 
% corresponds to a different patient, and the columns consist of Age, Blood
% Pressure, and Weight, in that order, from left to right.




% 2. Use Mat to find the logical row indicies corresponding to any patients
% over 70 years old. Report the number of patients over 70 years old in a
% complete sentence.




% 3. Define a new variable that is a subset of Mat, and consists of only 
% data from patients that are older than 70. Save this new matrix to a new
% .mat file.

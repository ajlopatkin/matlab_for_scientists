% Convert to grayscale and adjust as necessary

% Create mask using one/many combinations of techniques from class

% Plot 1x3 subplot:
%%%% Left: grayscale image
%%%% Middle: Mask
%%%% Right: original RGB image

% calculate boundaries

% loop through and plot boundaries on last subplot 

% calculate average intensity of all cells

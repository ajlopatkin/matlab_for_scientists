%%%%%%%%% Part 1 %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% inputs
% Read in image

%% Plotting
% Visualize it on subplot (1,3,1)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%% Part 2 %%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% calculations
% Determine the number of rows

% Determine the number of columnss

% Use row# and col# to determine indices corresponding to top left
% quarter (hint: if there are an odd number of rows, we may need to round
% the number)

% Define the image subset and plot


%% Plotting
% plot on subplot(1,3,2)

%% calculations

%%%%% horizontal line %%%%%
% Define the x vector to plot a horizontal line against (what values of x
% will it take?)

% Define the y vector to plot a horizontal line against (what values of y
% will it take?)


%%%%% vertical line %%%%%
% Define the x vector to plot a vertical line against (what values of x
% will it take?)

% Define the y vector to plot a vertical line against (what values of y
% will it take?)


%% Plotting
% Show original image and hold on subplot(1,3,3)

% Plot vertical and horizontal lines

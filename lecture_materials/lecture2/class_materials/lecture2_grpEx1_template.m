% 1. Generate a column vector of size 5x1 using both linspace and the
% transposition function. The values of the vector are up to you.



% 2. Concatenate the following matrices both horizontally and vertically
mat1 = ones(3,3);
mat2 = zeros(3,3);


% 3. Concatenate the following matrices using the correct method
mat3 = ones(3,3);
mat4 = zeros(1,3);

% 1. Load AcceptanceRates.mat. Look at the workspace to see what is stored.
% Note that the order of years in <year> corresponds to the acceptance
% rates in <acceptance>



% 2. We want to add new data from year 2017, where the acceptance rate was 25%.
% Define two new variables, acceptance2, where each vectors contains the
% data from acceptance and year, respectively, and also the new data from
% 2017


% 3. Save acceptance2 and year2 in a new mat file called
% AcceptanceRates2.mat



% 4. Update AcceptanceRate.mat with acceptance2 and year2 so it contains
% all 4 variables

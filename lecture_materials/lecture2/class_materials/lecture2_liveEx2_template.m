mat1 = [1 4 5;3 6 -10];
mat2 = [1 2 1; 3 3 3];

% 1. Add mat1 and mat2 and store in new variabile


% 2. Subtract mat2 from mat1 and store in new variable


% 3. Multiply mat1 and mat2 using elemental matrix multiplication and store
% in new variable


% 4. Calculate the square root of mat1 and store in new variable
